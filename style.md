# Code Style Guidelines

## 1. Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Follow camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes.
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants and enum values.
- Prefix private members with an underscore (_).

## 2. Code Structure
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Limit function length to 20-30 lines where possible.
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces or 1 tab) throughout the codebase.
- Group related code blocks and separate them with blank lines.
- Limit line length to 80-120 characters for improved readability.

## 3. Documentation
- Write clear and concise comments for complex logic or algorithms.
- Use JSDoc or similar documentation standards for functions and classes.
- Keep the README up-to-date with project setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- Include inline comments sparingly, focusing on explaining "why" rather than "what".

## 4. Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks for error-prone operations.
- Implement proper logging for errors and exceptions.
- Provide meaningful error messages that aid in debugging.
- Handle edge cases and validate input parameters.

## 5. Performance
- Optimize loops and avoid unnecessary iterations.
- Use appropriate data structures for efficient operations.
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
- Minimize DOM manipulation and batch updates when possible.

## 6. Security
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Follow the principle of least privilege in access control.

## 7. Testing
- Write unit tests for individual functions and components.
- Implement integration tests for critical system interactions.
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for core functionality.
- Use mock objects and stubs for external dependencies in tests.

## 8. Version Control
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Use feature branches for new developments.
- Perform code reviews before merging into the main branch.
- Keep commits small and focused on a single change or feature.

## 9. Code Reusability
- Create modular and reusable components.
- Implement DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Use design patterns appropriately to solve common problems.
- Favor composition over inheritance when designing class relationships.

## 10. Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements appropriately.
- Provide alternative text for images and media.
- Ensure keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.
- Follow WCAG guidelines for color contrast and text sizing.
